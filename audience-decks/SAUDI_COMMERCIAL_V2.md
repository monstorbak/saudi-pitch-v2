# SLIDE 1: THE PAIN - Vision 2030 Reality
## Aramco's $10B Annual Downtime

Industrial IoT in KSA: World-class sensors, cloud latency kills.

| Aramco Incident | Cost | Latency Issue |
|-----------------|------|---------------|
| Khurais field pressure spike | $500M+ | Cloud response: 100ms too late |
| Ras Tanura pump failure | $200M | GPS-denied zones common |

**Edge AI promise vs Reality: 50ms cloud RT = lost production.**

# SLIDE 2: WHY NOW - Saudi Opportunity
Vision 2030: $1T diversification from oil → smart manufacturing, NEOM.

**$110B Industrial TAM in KSA by 2030** (SABIC, Aramco, Ma'aden).

UWB RTLS + RNS: Precise asset tracking, zero drift.

---

# SLIDE 3: SOLUTION - Physics-Native Edge
RNS Cyclic Processor: 40x power save on rotations/vibrations.

Demo Integration: **UWB xG28 RTLS** - sub-cm positioning, mW power.
